# Student Lifestyle Analysis

Analyzed student behaviors using unsupervised learning models:
- **PCA**: Reduced dimensions to academic and social patterns.
- **K-Means**: Identified three student groups (academic, social, balanced).
- **NMF**: Highlighted latent features like alcohol use and grades.

## Key Insights
- Academic performance inversely correlates with alcohol use and social activity.
- Models complement each other in revealing patterns.

## Technologies
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
